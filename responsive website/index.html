                    scientific knowledge being used for practical purposes.
                    Technology is changing fast. They should be allowed to wait for cheaper technologies to be
                    developed.</p>

            <p class="secsubtag text-small">The use of tools by early humans was partly a process of discovery and of evolution. Early humans evolved from a species of foraging hominids which were already bipedal,[22] with a brain mass approximately one third of modern humans.[23] Tool use remained relatively unchanged for most of early human history. Approximately 50,000 years ago, the use of tools and complex set of behaviors emerged, believed by many archaeologists to be connected to the emergence of fully modern language</p>

            </p>
            <p class="secsubtag text-small">The distinction between science, engineering, and technology is not always clear. Science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation.[16] Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, because they have to satisfy requirements such as utility, usability, and safety.[17]

                Engineering is the goal-oriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science. The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, mathematical, linguistic, and historical knowledge, to achieve some practical result.</p>

            <p class="sectag text-big">Technicism</p>
            <p class="secsubtag text-small">Generally, technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies.[56] Taken to an extreme, technicism "reflects a fundamental attitude which seeks to control reality, to resolve all problems with the use of scientificâ€“technological methods and tools."[57] In other words, human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology. Some, such as Stephen V. Monsma,[58] connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher moral authority.</p>
